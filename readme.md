# Decentralized E-Book Library

## Project Description
The Decentralized E-Book Library is a smart contract built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create, own, and transfer digital books (eBooks) securely and transparently. Each eBook is stored with an IPFS hash, ensuring that users can access the content while retaining ownership on the blockchain.

## Contract Address
0x8029Fcf4908C6C00A02a0110f3765E5d1fa5433E

## Project Vision
Our vision is to create a decentralized platform for eBooks that empowers authors and readers alike. By leveraging blockchain technology, we aim to eliminate piracy, ensure fair compensation for authors, and provide readers with secure access to their favorite books.

## Key Features
- **EBook Creation**: Users can add new eBooks to the library by providing the title, author, and IPFS hash.
- **Ownership Management**: Each eBook is owned by a specific address, enabling true ownership of digital content.
- **Secure Transfer**: Users can transfer eBook ownership to others, with all transactions recorded on the blockchain.
- **User EBook Management**: Each user can easily view and manage their collection of eBooks through a simple interface.
- **Transparency**: All actions and ownership transfers are transparent and immutable, fostering trust among users.
